# Decentralized Peer Tutoring

## Project Description

The **Decentralized Peer Tutoring** project is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates a peer-to-peer tutoring system. It allows individuals to register as tutors and students, connect based on shared interests, and engage in educational sessions. Tutors can offer tutoring services with defined hourly rates, and students can book tutoring sessions based on their specific needs. The entire process, from registering tutors and students to handling payments, is governed by a smart contract on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and fairness.

By leveraging smart contracts, this system eliminates intermediaries and central authorities, providing a decentralized and trustless environment for education. Payment is handled automatically and securely through the blockchain, ensuring that tutors are compensated for their time and students only pay for services rendered.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Decentralization**: Empower students and tutors to interact without intermediaries, creating a peer-to-peer ecosystem.
- **Transparency and Security**: All tutoring sessions and payments are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Access to Education**: Make quality tutoring services available globally, allowing tutors to offer their services and students to find help in a decentralized and trustless environment.
- **Automation**: Smart contracts handle everything automatically, ensuring smooth transactions and eliminating human errors or fraud.

## Key Features

- **Tutor Registration**: Tutors can sign up by specifying their subject, hourly rate, and available hours. Once registered, they can be found by students looking for tutoring in those subjects.
  
- **Student Registration**: Students can register by specifying the subject they need tutoring in and the number of hours they require. The system automatically calculates the total cost of tutoring.
  
- **Session Management**: Tutors and students can start and end tutoring sessions with simple calls to the smart contract, marking the session as in-progress or completed.
  
- **Automated Payment Handling**: Payments are automatically transferred to the tutor once a tutoring session is started. This ensures both the tutor and student are committed before the service is provided.
  
- **Blockchain-Based Transparency**: All sessions, payments, and interactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing full transparency for all parties involved.
  
- **Security and Trust**: Smart contracts ensure that the terms of the agreement are met, including payment and availability, reducing the risk of fraud or misunderstandings.
  
- **Availability Status**: Tutors can set their availability status to "available" or "unavailable" to make it clear when they are ready to offer their services.

### Future Improvements

- **Rating and Feedback System**: After a session ends, students and tutors can rate each other, helping to build trust and improve the quality of the platform.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Implement a mechanism for resolving disputes between tutors and students (e.g., through arbitration or community voting).
- **Extended Functionality**: Add additional features like scheduling, group tutoring, and subscription models.
